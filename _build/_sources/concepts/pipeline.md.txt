# Pipeline
An Azure Machine Learning pipeline is an independently executable workflow of a complete machine learning task. Azure Machine Learning pipelines help you build, optimize, and manage machine learning workflows with simplicity, repeatability and quality assurance.

These benefits become significant as soon as your machine learning project moves beyond pure exploration and into iteration. Even simple one-step pipelines can be valuable. Machine learning projects are often in a complex state, and it can be a relief to make the precise accomplishment of a single workflow a trivial process.
