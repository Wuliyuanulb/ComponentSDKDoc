# Additional includes

By default, The folder containing the component spec file will be treated as the base folder of the component running environment (a.k.a the *snapshot*). However, sometimes some common libraries lays on other top level folders. In this case, use *additional includes* to set the additional file or folders used by the component. The file or folders in additional includes will be copied (optionally as a zip package) to the snapshot folder by the component-cli when registering the component.

To specify additional includes, add a `{spec_file_name}.additional_includes`  file next to the component spec file. For example, if the component spec file is named `component_spec.yaml`, the additional includes file should be named `component_spec.additional_includes`.

As an example, for the following folder structure:

```
src/
  python/
    library1/
      hello.py
    library2/
      en_US/
        messages.json
      zh_CN/
        messages.json
      greetings.py
assets/
  LICENSE
component_entry/
  component_spec.additional_includes
  component_spec.yaml
  run.py
```

Inside the `component_spec.additional_includes` file:

```yaml
../src/python/library1
../src/python/library2.zip
../assets/LICENSE
```

When packing snapshot, the contents inside the snapshot will be:

```
component_spec.yaml
run.py
library1/
  hello.py
library2.zip
LICENSE
```

library2 is copied as a zip package to the snapshot since it is specified with a `.zip` suffix in the additional_includes file. Inside library2.zip the files are:

```
library2/
  en_US/
    messages.json
  zh_CN/
    messages.json
  greetings.py
```

### Notes

* Additional includes file should be a plain text file, place each item in one line. The line break could be either `\r\n` or `\n`, but it is recommended to use `\n`.

* Specified additional file (or folder) will be copied directly into the base folder of the snapshot. No parent folders are included.

* Each item in the additional include file:

  * Could either be a file or a folder. In the sample above, `../src/python/library1` and `../src/python/library2` are folders, while `../assets/LECENSE` is a file.

  * Could be optionally specified with a `.zip` suffix. As an example, for entry item `../hello.zip`:
    * Check whether `../hello.zip` **file** exists. If it exists, copy `hello.zip` to snapshot folder.
    * If there is no `../hello.zip` file exist, check whether `../hello` **folder** exists. If so, compress the folder to a zip file and copy to snapshot folder as `hello.zip`.
    * If `../hello` exists but it is a file (not a folder), an "`../hello.zip` not found" error will be raised.

  * Must be specified with relative file path from the folder containing the component spec file. Absolute file path not accepted.

    * Good: `../src`
    * Bad: `/`, `C:`

  * Recommend to contain a specific folder or file name.

    * Recommended: `../src`, `../src/python/library1`, `../assets/LICENSE`
    * Not recommended: `../../`, `~`, `/`

  * Recommend to use linux-style path. Windows-style path will not work properly on Linux platforms.

    * Recommended: `../src/python/library1`
    * Not recommended: `..\src\python\library1`.


It would be helpful to test run the component before the component get registered to a workspace. For local testing, use `az ml component build` to build a local component snapshot with additional includes resolved.
