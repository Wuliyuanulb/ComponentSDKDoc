# How to use component spec schema in vscode

### Prerequisites

- Download vscode.

- Download vscode 'YAML' extension

### Associate component spec schema to your yaml files

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+p` in VS Code to toggle `Command Palette`, and enter "Settings" to find settings configurations. If you just want to use component spec schema in current opened folder, it recommended to choose "Preferences: Open Workspace Settings". Reference [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) for more information about settings in VS Code.

2. Find **Yaml:Schemas**  in opened settings page, click **Edit in settings.json**.

3. In **settings.json**, add below section:

    We provided a [merged schema](https://componentsdk.blob.core.windows.net/jsonschema/ComponentSchema.json ) to validate different kind of components:

    Here we configure to associate the component schema to all files that end with ".yaml".

    ```json
    {
        "yaml.schemas": {
            "https://componentsdk.blob.core.windows.net/jsonschema/ComponentSchema.json": ["**/*.yaml"]
        }
    }
    ```

    You can also change this to build your own association pattern. For example, below pattern will associate all yaml files start with 'aml'. Find more examples [here](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-yaml).

    ```json
    {
        "yaml.schemas": {
            "https://componentsdk.blob.core.windows.net/jsonschema/ComponentSchema.json": ["aml*.yaml"]
        }
    }
    ```

    The merged schema validates yaml specs by checking the `type` field in it.
    For example, if a schema has `type: ParallelComponent` in it, it will be validated as a parallel component.
    If `type` not specified in yaml spec, the yaml will be validated as a command component.

    Now you are all set.
    See below section to learn how to write component spec with the help of the schema.

### Writing component spec

After the configuration, you can follow the steps below to write a yaml.

1. Press `Ctrl+Space` or type "add" for hint, a list of templates for different kind of component will be shown, select one to get started.

   If `Ctrl+Space` not working for you, this hotkey may have been occupied by other programs. You can reference this [doc](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) and assign a new hotkey for command  **Trigger Suggest**.

2. Fill required fields in the template, use `tab` to switch between "<>" wrapped fields and replace them with your own definition.

   ![image-20210108232123038](../images/yaml-template.png)

   Here is a generated component template:

   ```yaml
   $schema: http://azureml/sdk-2-0/CommandComponent.json
   name: < Put your unique component Name here >
   version: 0.0.1
   display_name: < Put your component Display name here.>
   type: CommandComponent
   tags: 
     from_schema_snippet: true
   inputs: 
     < Your 1st Input name >: 
       type: path # reference https://aka.ms/azure-ml-component-specs#data-types for more details
       description: < Edit description for your input >  
     < Your 2nd Input name >: 
       type: path
       optional: true
       description: < Edit description for your input >  
   outputs: 
     < Your 1st Output name >: 
       type: path
       description: < Edit description for your output >  
   environment: 
     conda: 
       conda_dependencies: 
         name: project_environment
         channels: 
           - defaults
         dependencies: 
           - python=3.7.6
           - pip=20.0
           - pip:
             - azureml-sdk
             - < Specify your extra dependencies >      
     os: Linux
   command: < Your command file name >  --< Your 1st Input name > {inputs.< Your 1st Input name >} [--< Your 2nd Input name > {inputs.< Your 2nd Input name >}]  --< Your 1st Output name > {outputs.< Your 1st Output name >} 
   ```

3. If you need more fields for your spec, use `ctrl+space` to toggle hint about more supported fields.

4. Hover the mouse on fields to check the definition of the field.

5. If your yaml violates the schema, warning will be shown.
