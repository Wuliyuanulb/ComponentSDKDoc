# Getting Started

## Install Component SDK/CLI

### Find the lastest version

Currently component SDK & CLI are under active development. We will release a `stable version` to [the stable pypi index](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ml-component/#history) regularly (current about monthly cadence). Between two stable version, we might release several `preview versions` which contains new features and bugfix. You can find the latest preview version in [the preview pypi index](https://azuremlsdktestpypi.azureedge.net/modulesdkpreview/azure-ml-component). For CLI, we only provide preview version. We recommend customer to use same version of CLI & SDK to achieve consistent behavior.

[SDK Changelog](https://componentsdk.z22.web.core.windows.net/CHANGELOG.html) contains the history of stable releases. Feature set of upcomming release will also be in this page. You can also find the preview version number of critical bugfix in this page.

### Install component CLI

Install the latest version of the component CLI AML extension, which includes the `az ml component` command group.

```shell
# Login
az login -o none 

# Uninstall any previously installed azure-cli-ml (the `az ml` commands)
az extension remove -n azure-cli-ml 

# Install remote version of azure-cli-ml (which includes `az ml component` commands)
az extension add --source https://azuremlsdktestpypi.blob.core.windows.net/wheels/modulesdkpreview/azure_cli_ml-0.1.0.29211468-py3-none-any.whl --pip-extra-index-urls https://azuremlsdktestpypi.azureedge.net/modulesdkpreview --yes --verbose

# Verify the version of the azure-cli-ml extension
az extension list -o table
```

### Install component SDK

Install the latest version of the Azure ML SDK including the APIs to work with _components_ and _pipelines_.

We recommend first install dataset runtime to enable dataset registration in sample notebooks
```powershell
pip install azureml-dataset-runtime[fuse] --upgrade
```

As for component SDK, we have 3 choices to install: install the latest stable version, the latest preview version, or a specific version.

```shell
# Install the latest preview version: which has the latest bugfix
pip install azure-ml-component[notebooks] --extra-index-url https://azuremlsdktestpypi.azureedge.net/modulesdkpreview --upgrade

# Install the latest stable version
# pip install azure-ml-component[notebooks] --upgrade

# Install a specific version
# pip install azure-ml-component[notebooks]==0.1.0.<SDK VERSION> --extra-index-url https://azuremlsdktestpypi.azureedge.net/modulesdkpreview

```
